Changes for next time:

- Python cheatsheet
- Fix image dimensions
- Use `Circle` and `Rectangle` as demo and assignment for custom classes intro
- Use `Height` as the assignment class, not the demo class (so we can extend to
  metric)
- Use `Duration` for the demo class (instead of `Time`) to (12 <-> 0) quirkiness
- Add tests to handle negative values
