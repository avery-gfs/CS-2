Here are some practice problems. You aren't expected to know how to do all of these entering the course. I'll assign some of them as in-class work in the future, but feel free to work on them on your own if you want a challenge.

1. Print out your name.

2. Store your name in a variable and print it out.

3. Get a name as input and print out "Hello (name)".

4. Get a number as input and print out "positive", "negative", or "zero" depending on the sign of the number.

5. Get two numbers as input. Print "ok" if one of the numbers is odd (but not both).
