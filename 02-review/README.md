## Problems

Number guessing game: generate a random integer between 1 and 100. Ask the user for guesses. After each guess, tell the user if the guess was too high or low. Repeat until the user guesses the correct number.

Palindrome finder: download `unixdict.txt` from the data folder of this repository. Write a program to read the words in the file and find the palindromes (words that are the same in reverse as forwards). Find the longest palindrome in the file.
